# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  NEW TASK: Simple UI updates for referral page and location filter
  
  1. Add multi-language translations to referral page (EN, FR, TH, AR)
  2. Verify dynamic location dropdown is working (fetching from actual raffles)
  
  Notes:
  - Location filter already implemented via LocationFilter component
  - Backend endpoint /api/raffles/locations/list already exists
  - Just need to add translations to referral.tsx

          Created GET /api/users/me/vouchers endpoint to list all user's vouchers (prizes won).

          - GET /api/users/me/winners: Returns enriched winner records with full voucher and raffle details
          - Fixed MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue in winners endpoint

          Created POST /api/admin/raffles/upload-secret-codes endpoint for uploading secret codes to digital prize raffles.
          Accepts raffleId and secretCodes array, cleans and deduplicates codes, updates raffle with secretCodes and sets isDigitalPrize=true.

          Updated POST /api/admin/raffles endpoint to calculate minimumDrawDate based on prizeValueUSD tier when creating raffles.
          Uses calculate_minimum_draw_date() helper function: 1-15 USD = next day, 16-25 USD = 3 days, 26+ USD = 1 week.

          Removed duplicate Voucher model definition. Now using single comprehensive Voucher model with fields:
          voucherRef, userId, userName, userEmail, raffleId, raffleTitle, partnerId, partnerName, prizeValue, currency,
          isDigitalPrize, secretCode, verificationCode, status, validUntil, partner contact info.

      CURRENT TASK: Fix critical Profile page crash and complete translation system.
      
      ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
      1. ❌ Profile.tsx is importing from WRONG translation file:
         - Currently: import { translations } from '../../src/utils/translations';
         - Should use: useTranslation() hook from '../../src/i18n/useTranslation';
         - This mismatch is causing the TypeError: Object is not a function crash
      
      2. ⚠️ Rewards page has hardcoded English text (no translations)
      
      3. ⚠️ French and Arabic translations incomplete
      
      PLAN:
      1. Fix profile.tsx to use correct translation system (useTranslation hook)
      2. Add missing translations for Rewards page to /src/i18n/translations.ts
      3. Update Rewards page to use translation system
      4. Complete French and Arabic translations
      5. Test all changes

      PREVIOUS TASK: Simple UI updates - Referral page translations and location filter verification.
      
      COMPLETED CHANGES:
      1. ✅ Referral Page Multi-Language Support:
         - Added useTranslation hook import to referral.tsx
         - Replaced all hardcoded text with translation keys (t() function)
         - All text now displays in user's selected language (EN, FR, TH, AR)
         - Updated: title, subtitle, code/link labels, buttons, "How it works" section
         
      2. ✅ Dynamic Location Filter (Already Working):
         - LocationFilter component already implemented
         - Fetches unique locations from GET /api/raffles/locations/list backend endpoint
         - Backend returns distinct locations from active raffles, sorted alphabetically
         - Shows "All", "Use My Location", then dynamic list
         - No changes needed, feature already complete
      
      READY FOR TESTING:
      - Frontend: Test referral page displays correctly in all 4 languages
      - Frontend: Test location filter shows dynamic locations from raffles

      Phase 1 investigation for Expo Go launch issue completed. Verified that the manifest endpoint correctly returns JSON for both Android and iOS and that the Android JS bundle is accessible:
      - Checked https://winwai-fix-1.preview.emergentagent.com/index.exp?platform=android → JSON manifest OK (contains launchAsset url to ngrok)
      - Checked https://winwai-fix-1.preview.emergentagent.com/index.exp?platform=ios → JSON manifest OK
      - Checked https://winwai-app.ngrok.io/node_modules/expo-router/entry.bundle?platform=android → Bundle loads (second attempt succeeded after an initial timeout)
      Likely previous failures were due to transient ngrok connectivity/caching on device. Recommend: clear Expo Go cache, update Expo Go, ensure same Wi‑Fi, and rescan QR. No app.json or env changes required. Will proceed to CRUD once user confirms native launch works now.
